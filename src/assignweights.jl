    geo_to_xy(geo, i, j)

i and j are 1-based.

In case of north up images, the GT(2) and GT(4) coefficients are zero, and the
GT(1) is pixel width, and GT(5) is pixel height. The (GT(0),GT(3)) position is
the top left corner of the top left pixel of the raster.

Note that the pixel/line coordinates in the above are from (0.0,0.0) at the top
left corner of the top left pixel to (width_in_pixels,height_in_pixels) at the
bottom right corner of the bottom right pixel. The pixel/line location of the
center of the top left pixel would therefore be (0.5,0.5).
